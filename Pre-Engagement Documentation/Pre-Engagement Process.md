# Penetration Testing Process

The Penetration Testing Process simulates the _cyber kill chain model_.

## Pre-Engagement

Pre-engagement involves educating the client and defining the terms of the engagement. All necessary tests and their components are clearly defined and contractually recorded. These details are usually discussed in a face-to-face meeting or conference call.

Key components of pre-engagement include:

- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**  
  - Unilateral  
  - Bilateral  
  - Multilateral

- **Goals**

- **Scope**  
  - Scoping Questionnaire (Before Pre-Engagement Meeting)  
  - Scoping Document (During Pre-Engagement Meeting)

- **Time Estimation**

- **Rules of Engagement**

**Note**: _It is essential to know who in the company is permitted to contract us for a penetration test. We cannot accept a request from everyone._
