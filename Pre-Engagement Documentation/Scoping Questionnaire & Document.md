# Scoping Questionnaire Guidelines

The scoping questionnaire should be sent to the hiring party **before** the pre-engagement meeting.

The hiring party should provide the following information:
- Client name  
- Client address  
- Contact information  

This scoping questionnaire should clearly outline the services offered and typically asks the client to select one or more of the following assessments:

- Internal Vulnerability Assessment  
- Internal Penetration Test  
- External Vulnerability Assessment  
- External Penetration Test  
- Wireless Security Assessment  
- Application Security Assessment  
- Web Application Security Assessment  
- Physical Security Assessment  
- Social Engineering Assessment  
- Red Team Assessment  

## Additional Assessment Details

- Specify the type of assessment: **Black Box**, **Gray Box**, or **White Box**
- For Social Engineering:
  - Do they want only **phishing**?
  - Should **vishing calls** also be included?

### Critical Scoping Questions

- How many expected live hosts?  
- How many IPs or CIDR ranges are in scope?  
- How many domains/subdomains are in scope?  
- How many wireless SSIDs are in scope?  
- How many web or mobile applications are in scope?  
- If testing is authenticated, how many roles (e.g., standard user, admin) need to be tested?  
- For phishing assessments:
  - How many users will be targeted?
  - Will the client provide the user list, or will we need to gather it via OSINT?
- For Physical Security Assessments:
  - How many locations are in scope?
  - Are the sites geographically dispersed?
- What is the objective of the Red Team Assessment?
- Are any activities out of scope (e.g., phishing, physical attacks)?
- Is a separate **Active Directory Security Assessment** requested?
- Will network testing be done as an anonymous user or a standard domain user?
- Do we need to bypass **Network Access Control (NAC)**?
