## Information Gathering

The **Information Gathering** stage begins after the **Pre-Engagement** phase has been completed.

In this phase, we collect all available information about the target organization, including:
- Employees and personnel
- Digital infrastructure
- Network architecture
- Public-facing assets and how they interconnect

Information gathering is both the **most frequent** and one of the **most critical** phases in the penetration testing process. Due to the **stochastic** (non-linear and adaptive) nature of penetration testing, we often revisit the **OSINT** phase multiple times as new insights are uncovered.

### Common Sources of Information

- **Public Repositories** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):  
  These platforms are frequently misconfigured, unintentionally exposing sensitive data to external users.

- **Search Engines and Indexing Tools** (e.g., Google Dorking)

- **Social Media & Corporate Websites**  
  Employee names, email formats, job roles, and technologies in use.

- **WHOIS and DNS Records**

- **Paste Sites and Breach Dumps**

Thorough information gathering enhances the accuracy and efficiency of later phases, such as vulnerability analysis and exploitation.
